1 Navigating Directories: Use commands like cd to navigate through directories.
2 Running Commands: Execute commands such as ls (list files), npm install (install npm packages), git status (check Git status), etc.
3 Running Scripts: Run scripts and commands directly from the terminal, such as npm start, python app.py, etc.
4 Output and Errors: View command output and error messages directly within VS Code.
5 Terminal Settings: Customize terminal settings via Terminal -> Configure Terminal Settings or by modifying settings.json to adjust shell type, font size, color scheme, etc.

Advantages of the Integrated Terminal:
1 Seamless Integration: The integrated terminal is tightly integrated within the VS Code environment, allowing for quick access without switching to an external terminal window.
2 Contextual Awareness: It operates in the context of your project workspace, meaning it automatically opens at the root of your current project. This context-awareness simplifies navigation and execution of commands related to your project.
3 Workspace Persistence: The terminal state (including command history) persists across VS Code sessions. This allows you to retain terminal sessions and their history even after closing and reopening VS Code.
4 Enhanced Productivity: Since the terminal is within the same window as your code editor, you can easily switch between writing code and running commands without losing focus or disrupting your workflow.
5 Customization: VS Code allows customization of the integrated terminal's appearance and behavior through settings, which can be tailored to fit your preferences and workflow.
6 Integration with Tasks: It can be defined and run tasks directly from the integrated terminal or use the integrated task runner, allowing for streamlined automation and workflow management.
7 Debugging Integration: It seamlessly integrates with VS Code's debugging features, enabling you to run and debug applications directly from the integrated terminal

When to Use an External Terminal:
 Environments: In scenarios where your project requires interactions across multiple terminals or complex setups not easily managed by the integrated terminal.

External Tools Dependency: For tools or scripts that require specific configurations or are more efficiently managed in a dedicated terminal window.
